![Pose Detection Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-username/banner.png) <!-- Optional image banner -->

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **Real-Time 3D Human Pose Detection and Tracking System** built using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **Python**. It captures human body poses from a live video stream (webcam or CCTV), detects 33 landmark points, and visualizes them in real-time — making it ideal for applications like fitness tracking, gesture recognition, fall detection, human-computer interaction, and more.

## ✨ Features

- 📌 **Real-Time 3D Pose Detection** using MediaPipe
- 📷 **Live feed support** from webcam or CCTV cameras (RTSP/HTTP)
- 🎯 Tracks 33 key human body landmarks in 3D
- 📊 Expandable for Pose Classification & Activity Recognition
- 🔁 Smooth real-time performance with OpenCV
- ⚙️ Easy to integrate with web frontends via Flask/FastAPI
